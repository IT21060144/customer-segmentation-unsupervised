# Customer Segmentation using KMeans and DBSCAN

## Overview
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to segment customers based on financial behavior. Using KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms, we grouped customers using two key features: Annual Income and Spending Score.

## Project Files
- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full preprocessing and clustering implementation.
- `customer_segmentation_report.pdf`: Full project report with results, discussion, and source code.
- `Customer_Segmentation_10_Slides.pptx`: Visual presentation with clustering results and algorithm comparison.

A simulated dataset with 200 customers, including:
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1–100)`

## Algorithms Used
- **KMeans**: Centroid-based clustering; efficient but requires predefined `k`.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering; detects noise and arbitrary cluster shapes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas

## How to Run
1. Open `customer_segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to view clustering process and results.

## Presentation
- Use `Customer_Segmentation_10_Slides.pptx` or `Customer_Segmentation_Scripted_Presentation.pptx` for demo.
- Read narration script or record with Loom/Zoom.
